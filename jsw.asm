; Entity specifications
;
; Initialised upon entry to a room and then used by the routine at INITROOM.
;
; There are eight pairs of bytes here that hold the entity specifications for
; the current room. The first byte in each pair identifies one of the entity
; definitions at ENTITYDEFS. The meaning of the second byte depends on the
; entity type: it determines the base sprite index and x-coordinate of a
; guardian, the y-coordinate of an arrow, or the x-coordinate of the top of a
; rope.

; Entity buffers
;
; Initialised by the routine at INITROOM, and used by the routines at
; MOVETHINGS and DRAWTHINGS. There are eight buffers here, each one eight bytes
; long, used to hold the state of the entities (rope, arrows and guardians) in
; the current room.
;
; For a horizontal guardian, the eight bytes are used as follows:

; Rope animation table
;
; Used by the routine at DRAWTHINGS. The first half of this table controls the
; x-coordinates at which the segments of rope are drawn, and the second half
; controls the y-coordinates. For a given rope animation frame F
; (0x00<=F<=0x36), the 32 entries from F to F+31 inclusive (one for each of the
; 32 segments of rope below the topmost one) in each half of the table are
; used; thus the batch of entries used 'slides' up and down the table as F
; increases and decreases.
